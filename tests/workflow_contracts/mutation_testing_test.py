"""Contract tests for the mutation-testing caller workflow.

The executable logic lives in the ``leynos/shared-actions`` reusable
workflow, which carries its own unit and integration tests;
wildside-engine's caller is declarative configuration. These tests parse
the caller with PyYAML and pin the contract it must uphold, so drift
(repointing the pin at a branch, widening permissions, or losing the
workspace paths, scaffolding excludes, or test-support feature args)
fails CI on the pull request rather than surfacing in a scheduled or
manual run.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
