"""Contract tests for the mutation-testing caller workflow.

The executable logic lives in the ``leynos/shared-actions`` reusable
workflow, which carries its own unit and integration tests;
wildside-engine's caller is declarative configuration. These tests parse
the caller with PyYAML and assert that it references the correct reusable
workflow at a commit SHA, and that the other structural guards (triggers,
permissions, and the ``with:`` inputs) hold, so drift (repointing the
reference at a branch, widening permissions, or losing the workspace
paths, scaffolding excludes, or test-support feature args) fails CI on
the pull request rather than surfacing in a scheduled or manual run.
Dependabot owns the pinned SHA value; these tests do not assert which
commit is pinned.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
